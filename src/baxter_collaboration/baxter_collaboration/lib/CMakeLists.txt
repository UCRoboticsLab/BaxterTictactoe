## Add cmake target dependencies of the library
## as an example, code may need to be generated before libraries
## either from message generation or dynamic reconfigure
add_dependencies(flatpack_furniture ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})

## Specify libraries to link a library or executable target against
target_link_libraries(flatpack_furniture    ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

## Mark libraries for installation
install (TARGETS flatpack_furniture
         ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
         LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
)

## Mark cpp header files for installation
install(DIRECTORY   ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/flatpack_furniture
        DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_INCLUDE_DESTINATION}
        FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.h"
)
