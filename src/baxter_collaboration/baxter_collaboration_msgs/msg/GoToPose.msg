# Type of command to send. It can be one of the following:
# pose        to request a 6D pose
# position    to request a 3D position and keeping the current orientation
# relative_x  to request an increment relative to the current pose in the x axis
# relative_y  to request an increment relative to the current pose in the y axis
# relative_z  to request an increment relative to the current pose in the z axis
# stop        to stop the motion of the robot altogether (if it was moving)
string type

# Control mode to control the robot with. For now, only position mode is
# allowed. In the near future, also velocity mode will be allowed, in order
# to directly control the robot's joints in velocity.
